This is a script made for my master thesis in Mechanical Engineering.

The study is about optimize cellular materials (lattice structures) with a topology optimization algorithm (ANSYS). Then the optimized structure is redesign to a more stable structure (with multiple designs). After the redesign it was made a static structural analysis for each model where the load and displacement data was exported.

That data was used in this script to compute the specific stiffness and energy absorption for each model studied.
